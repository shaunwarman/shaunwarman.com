As of this writing (April 3, 2020), I've been a Software Engineer at PayPal for just over 6 years. Currently on the Web Platform team, curating the developer experience and taking advantage of our Content Delivery Networks (CDNs). I've worked on the node framework team, back-end payments, and a couple of product teams here. It's been a wonderful ride. Before the I worked in the defense industry and NASA before that.

Outside of work, I code on open source, climb and drink a lot of good coffee. And most importantly, enjoy time with my wife, Ana, here in Austin, TX.
